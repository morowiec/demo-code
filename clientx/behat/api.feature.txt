Feature: FAQs API
  In order to ensure the webiste is alive (minimally functional)
  As a normal user
  I want to make sure that important features of the FAQ are available

  Scenario: Anonymous user can see a FAQ main page
    Given "categories" terms:
    | name         |
    | Category one |
    | Category two |
    When I am on "help"
    Then I should see the text "FAQs"
    And I should see "Category one"
    And I should see "Category two"
    #And show last response

  Scenario: Anonymous user can see a FAQ category page
    Given "categories" terms:
    | name         |
    | FAQ_category |
    And "Client | FAQ" content:
    | title   | status | promoted | path[pathauto] | body        | field_question_ref_categories |
    | FAQ_1   | 1      | 1        | 1              | FAQ_content | FAQ_category                  |
    When I am viewing a "categories" term with the name "FAQ_category"
    Then I should see the text "FAQs"
